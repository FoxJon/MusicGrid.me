MusicGrid.me Hack-A-Thon

This is a project I put together with a small team over a weekend hackathon. This was my portion of the project. 

My task was to create a log in using Parse. I also created the ability to log in using Facebook. Once logged in, it would then grab three of your music “likes”. I worked with a designer to build out the UI elements.

*** This is a demonstration of what techniques I achieved over a 48-hour period and has not yet been tested for stability. ***
